        <h2> Getting Started </h2>
        <p>
            Locate your Undertale save folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>MAC</h3>
          <code>C:\users\[YourUsername]\Local Settings\Application Data\UNDERTALE</code>
            <h3>PC</h3>
            <code>C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\UNDERTALE</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            It should contain <strong>at least</strong> a file called <code>undertale.ini</code>
            and a file called <code>file0</code>, unless you haven't saved your game yet, or the
            save was deleted.
        </p>
        <h2> Loading </h2>
        <p>
            Once you have located your save, you can load it into the editor to edit it.
        </p>
        <p>
            You don't have to load an existing save though, you can select a preset instead at the top,
            or use the default preset. Although if you aren't gonna screw around a bit with your files, why did you come here...?
        </p>
        <h2> Editing </h2>
        <p>
            Self-explanatory. Just edit the stuff you like. Check out the wiki or something if you're havin' trouble knowing what stuff is.
        </p>
        <h2> Saving </h2>
        <p>
            Finished? Simply hit the save button on the file of your choosing to download it to your computer. Easy, now just replace your original <code>file0</code> and <code>undertale.ini</code> with the ones you downloaded.
        </p>
        <h2> Recovering an Erased World/Undoing Selling Your Soul </h2>
        <p>
            Erased your world? <code>system_information_962</code> should be present in your Undertale folder.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sold your soul to get the world back? You should also see a file called <code>system_information_963</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
           
        </p>
        <p>
          Warning about trying to get your world back: The Steam version of the game is really funky with backing up save files and such. So, you might find those files returned upon Steam Cloud syncing. I don't exactly know how to help you here. Sorry.
